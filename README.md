## Created a cocktail search app

First week of assignment at Codaisseur was to create a cocktail app which you can search how to make a cocktail!
I have two versions - one in JS and one in TypeScript. This one was made with TypeScript and React.
You can see the live website which is deployed with Netlify here: https://cocktailapp-rw.netlify.app/
